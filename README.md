## Project Details
Below is some boring technical documentation. Feel free to skip if you only want to use it.

### Project Development Environment
- **Unity 2022.3.4f1**

### Project Progress
* Confirmed to work properly.

#### 기타 잡담
* UI design is tedious << Please don’t assign such tasks to engineers...

#### 예정 중인 기능
* Ah... It's need to do the English translation...
* If there are requests for other languages, I might consider it.
* I’m considering changing the input method as it’s a bit inconvenient (e.g., moving with Tab or using clicks/sliders).
